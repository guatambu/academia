    // Core Data
        // create models specifically for persistance
        // refactor existing models
        // set up Core Data structure to support the immediate collection and storage of data
        // on owner side - the data is then sent to cloud backup via batches or individual user granted action
        // on student side - the student does not need to use CoreData, only the owner does, so all student ineractions will be with cloud server ( Firebase Firestore )
        // the flow would be... an action sheet or allert popup that gives the option to save and upload later to cloud, or save and upload to cloud at same time
        // owner would have the option to choose in settings whether they want to save and upload a batch or save and upload a batch later... batch later - this would be for quick response on the mat... batch same time if you are confident in your wifi

        // text and limited response first... add in pics, vids, gifs etc. later
        // all communications have a 10 shelf life and then dissappear
