    // Core Data
        // create models
        // refactor existing models
        // refactor existing model controllers
        // set up Core Data structure to support the immediate collection and storage of data
        // on owner side - the data is then sent to cloud backup via batches or individual user granted action
        // on student side - same idea as owner
        // the flow would be... an action sheet or allert popup that gives the option to save and upload later to cloud, or save and upload to cloud at same time
        // owner would have the option to choose in settings whether they want to save and upload a batch or save and upload a batch later... batch later - this would be for quick response on the mat... batch same time if you are confident in your wifi

    // Picker Wheels
        // Owner New Payment Program
        // Owner Add class
        // Belt Creation?

    // Add new Students to group Button fucntionality

    // Stripe integration for monthly payments per agreement terms
    // Stripe integration for in house product sales

    // Firebase integration
        // hopefully quick and easy

    // messaging
        // push notifications from owner to students re: events/opportunities
        // actual messaging between owner and instructors
        // limited two way communication between owner and students/parents... ownercan say a lot, and get aggregate canned responses back from audience limiting their responses to just the necessary details
        // text and limited response first... add in pics, vids, gifs etc. later
        // all communications have a 10 shelf life and then dissappear
